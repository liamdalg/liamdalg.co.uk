Hey, I'm Liam, a software engineer who likes software security and browser
automation. I dabble mostly in Golang, Kubernetes, and Typescript/NodeJS. I'd
love to spend time getting better at C++ and Rust, but haven't found the
project.

Sorry, my blog is a Hugo SPA as frontend isn't my favourite. Someday I'll move
it over to minimal HTML with no JS :)
