Hey. I'm Liam. I'm a Software Engineer at [Netcraft](https://netcraft.com) working on phishing classification. I'm
your stereotypical Software Engineer who loves bouldering and making cocktails (I make a mean espresso martini
and daiquiri!)

Dev facts:
* I'm particularly interested in cybersecurity and mathematics; currently trying to get good at Hack The Box and
  reverse engineering.
* My favourite languages to use are C# and Go, but I really wish I was good at Rust and Haskell instead.
* Against my will I've become pretty good at `Node.js`.
* I hate Perl.
