Hey. I'm Liam. I'm a Software Engineer at [Netcraft](https://netcraft.com) working on automated phishing classification.
I'm a stereotypical nerd who loves bouldering, video games, and making cocktails. I've been trying to keep up with
writing a blog for around 5 years now â€” as you can see it's going well!

* Trying to get good at Hack The Box and reverse engineering.
* Favourite languages I wish I used: Rust and Haskell.
* Favourite languages I actually use: C#, TypeScript, and Go.
* KDE + Visual Studio Code stan.
* Against my will I've become pretty good at Node.js.
* I hate Perl.
